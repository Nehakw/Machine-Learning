# Machine-Learning
This section includes all the Assignments and Project work during my master's course
I implemented KNN, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression algorithms on various datasets.
In the final project, data analysis is done with two classification algorithms one is Decision Tree (C5.0) and Naive Bayes.
To improve the model performance, I applied 10-fold cross validation technique. 
To achieve high accuracy, after cross validation, I appled Parameter Tuning followded by Ensemble Learning. Here, I choose Bagging
method of Ensemble Learning.
