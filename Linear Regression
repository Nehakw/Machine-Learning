In this homework, you need to implement a linear regression model.
1. Load Boston.cvs data set. It records 14 variables for 506 neighborhoods around Boston:
crim: per capita crime rate by town.
zn: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
indus: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
chas: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
nox: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
rm: average number of rooms per dwelling.
age: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
dis: weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centers.
rad: index of accessibility to radial highways.
tax: full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000.
ptratio: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
black: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
lstat: lower status of the population (percent).
medv: median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s.
2. Do any of the suburbs of Boston appear to have particularly high median home values? Low crime rates? Low pupil-teacher ratios? Comment on the range of each of these variables. Which suburbs have high median home values and low pupil-teacher ratios and low crime rates?
3. How many suburbs in this data set bound the Charles river?
4. Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response variable medv using all other variables.
For which variables the corresponding regression coefficients are likely to be significant?
5. On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller linear regression model that only uses predictors for which there is evidence of association with medv.
6. How well the models in 4 and 5 fit the data? 
7. Try to reduce the set of predictors by making correlation and scatterplot matrices. 
8. Fit even a smaller model using the predictors of your choice.
9. Investigate possible interactions between the variables in the last model. Try to find a model with R2>77.
Write a short report providing the answers to the questions above. Your submission must consist of two text files:
- a text file, report.txt, no longer than a page,
